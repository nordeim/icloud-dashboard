Those environment variables are your Firebase configuration values. You get them directly from the Firebase console. Here's how:

- Go to the Firebase Console: Open your browser and navigate to the Firebase console ( console.firebase.google.com  - remember, I can't provide direct links, but this is the standard URL). Log in with your Google account associated with your Firebase project ( notetaking-14009 ).

- Select your Project: Choose the "notetaking-14009" project from your project list.

- Navigate to Project Settings: In the left-hand navigation menu, click on the gear icon (Settings) and then select "Project settings".

- Find Your Web App: In the "Your apps" section, you should see a listing of your web apps. If you haven't added a web app yet to your project, you need to add one by clicking the "+ Add app" button. Select the "Web" platform, and give your app a name.

- Get the Config: In the "SDK setup and configuration" section, you will find a <script> tag that includes your Firebase configuration. Look for the firebaseConfig object within that <script> You should see something like this:

```nodejs
// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID" // This may or may not be present
};
```
Important Note: Because you're not using Google Analytics, the measurementId will likely be absent or empty.

- Copy the Values: Carefully copy the values associated with apiKey , authDomain , projectId , storageBucket , messagingSenderId , and appId . Do not copy the entire firebaseConfig object; instead, copy the individual values.

- Populate .env.local : Paste the values into your .env.local file, matching them to the correct environment variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
```
Remember to replace the YOUR_ placeholders with the actual values you copied from the Firebase console.

*Security Considerations:*

NEXT_PUBLIC_ Prefix: Notice the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix on your environment variables. This makes these variables accessible in the client-side JavaScript code of your Next.js application. Never store sensitive information (like API keys, database passwords, etc.) that should be kept server-side in client-side environment variables.

Server-Side Functions (For Sensitive Data): For any sensitive data (which is almost always the case with API keys), you should generally avoid putting them directly in your frontend code. Consider using Cloud Functions for Firebase to handle any server-side interactions that require these keys, keeping them out of the client's reach entirely.

After setting these environment variables, restart your Next.js development server to ensure the changes are picked up. Remember to keep your .env.local file out of version control (add it to your .gitignore ).
